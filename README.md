# RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic 2-person game; a modern variant of this adds two extra elements (Lizard and Spock) with the basic idea remaining the same. In each round, the two players simultaneously throw a random “hand” with one of the elements,

This a simple game modeled after the modified version (Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock). To keep things simple, this will be a single-player (PvE) game where the player plays against the device (computer/phone)
